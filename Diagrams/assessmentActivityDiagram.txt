Leaf Assessment Activity diagram

The system will allow lecturers to create, modify and remove aggregate and leaf assessments. 
Leaf assessments are assessments to which an atomic mark is assigned. An
assessment is by default not published implying that students cannot, by default, query their marks
for an assessment.
